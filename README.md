# Challenge_10
In conclusion, we have utilized Python and SQLAlchemy to perform a basic climate analysis. By using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, we gained a better understanding of how to interact with the database and retrieve the necessary data for analysis.

Specifically, we focused on creating a precipitation analysis. We connected to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, reflected the tables into ORM classes, and established a session for querying.

To analyze the precipitation data, we fetched the dates and precipitation values for the last 12 months and converted them into a pandas DataFrame. We then performed various operations on the DataFrame, such as calculating summary statistics and plotting the precipitation values over time.

By leveraging SQLAlchemy and Python, we have been able to easily access and analyze climate data in a structured and efficient manner. This example provides a starting point for further explorations and more advanced climate analysis tasks.
